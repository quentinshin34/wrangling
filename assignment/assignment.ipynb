        "1. This paper is about the importance of a consistent data structure. By tidying data in structures to rows and columns for every variable and observation, respectively, there can be specific tools for efficient cleaning and analyzing data.\n",
        "2. The tidy data standard is intended to \"facilitate initial exploration and analysis of the data and to simplify the development of data analysis tools that work together\". Essentially, putting in time and effort to tidy the data will make the analysis much easier, and the consistent structures allows tools to work together to make facilitate the analyses.\n",
        "3. 3.1: Messy datasets are very hard to work with because each is unique, and you do not know the structure of multiple different messy datasets. When datasets are tidy, they are alike and you can interact with the data simlarly.\n",
        "  3.2: It is difficult to define variables and observations in general because there are many, many different contexts and structure of the data in each different case. It is very hard to generalize variables across different examples, so tidying data may need slightly different approaches.\n",
        "4. A data set is a collection of values (usually numbers or strings), every value belongs to a variable, all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units, and an observation, all values measured on the same unit across attributes.\n",
        "5. Tidy data is a standard way of mapping the meaning of a dataset to its structure, so that each variable forms a column, each observation forms a row, and each type of observational unit forms a table.\n",
        "6. 5 most common problems in messy data:\n",
        "  1. Column headers are values, not names\n",
        "  2. Multiple variables in one column\n",
        "  3. Variables stored in rows and columns\n",
        "  4. Multiple obesrvational units in same table\n",
        "  5. A single observational unit in multiple tables\n",
        "  The data in table 4 are messy because it needs to be melted so that the we do not have to parse through each income group when interacting with the data. After melting, the numeric values will be in a column \"freq\" or something similar.\n",
        "  Melting a data set means turning columns into row.\n",
        "7. Table 12 is tidy because it has one variable in eahc column and each row represents a day's operation. Table 11 is messy because the element column has variable names.\n",
        "8. Tidy tools will be linked to tidy data, independently changing data structures or data tools will not improve working with the data. Both tools and the data need to work together and be efficient. Wickham hopes that others will build on the framework of tidy data to develop better storage strategies and tools. He also hopes to improve the understanding of the cognitive side of data analysis and generally make other data cleaning tasks easier and more efficient.\n"
